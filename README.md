# End of Term test work flow

## Introduction
At the end of each term we need to conduct a test on all of our students. For this I use GoodNotes with a PDF copy of the test paper for each student.
I Use Notion for tracking their scores and writing up a report.
_Notion workflow not included here_

## Set Up
1. Make sure classes names and student names are upto date for the current term.
2. Make sure to have a pdf copy of the test paper
3. Update `set_up.py` with the the above info
4. run the script

This should create a directory for each class, and a test paper of each student of that class.

### Goodnote
The next set is to take these test papers and add them to a new directory in GoodNotes
