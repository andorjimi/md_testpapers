# End of Term test workflow

## Introduction
At the end of each term, we administer a test to all our students. For this, I use GoodNotes with a PDF copy of the test paper for each student.
I use Notion for tracking their scores and writing reports.
_Notion workflow is not included here_.

## Set Up

### Tools Needed
- Notion: _Write reports, store result data.
- Word: _Write and print out the grading sheets._
- GoodNotes: _Conduct the test on an iPad.


### Prep
1. Ensure class names and student names are up to date for the current term.
2. Make sure to have a PDF copy of the test paper
3. Update `set_up.py` with the above info
4. Run the script

This should create a directory for each class and a test paper for each student in that class.

### Goodnote
The next step is to add these test papers to a new directory in GoodNotes. I discovered this year that it is easier to do this on the Mac by simply dragging the files over.

## Testing
While testing the students, I will enter their results and notes about their
performance in Notion.


## Ship
Ship here means to share it with the main teachers so that they can do their
Feedback with the parents

### Tools Needed
- Notion _Export Reports_
- GoodNotes _Export Test Papers_
- Baidu Cloud _Shared File System_
